**Why am I here?**
I am on Github for the reasons I provided and
I want to explore the community's
creations as well as find entertainment.

**Why Minecraft?**
I chose Minecraft because it is an open
sandbox game, with "no rules to follow"
and "the only limit is your imagination".
I find that i can express myself through
limitless ways in this world.

**Conclusion**
So, in summary, I want to help you
and entertain you in Minecraft datapacks. I like Minecraft because of its open-ness
and Iâ€™m on Github to share my creations.
